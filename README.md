# P7: MyReads -- A Book Tracking App

The goal of this project was to transform the static example into an interactive App with React.

The App has two pages. The main page shows three shelfs in which individual books can be sorted. Each book can only be on one shelf. The books are fetched via an API [BooksAPI.js](BooksAPI.js). To add new books to the collection, the main page provides a link to the second page, the search page. There the user can search for books. The search is limited to a small selection of keywords, which are documented in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). The results are limited to 20.

## How to run the app

Download or clone the repository onto your local machine and:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
